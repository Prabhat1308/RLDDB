# Distributed Database Development Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the high-level steps required to create a distributed database from scratch. The goal is to build a basic distributed key-value store with partitioning, replication, and basic consistency mechanisms.

## Steps

### 1. Define the Architecture

- Decide on the architecture (e.g., master-slave, peer-to-peer, sharding).
- Define the components and their interactions.

### 2. Data Partitioning

- Choose a partitioning strategy (e.g., range partitioning, hash partitioning, consistent hashing).
- Implement the partitioning logic to distribute data across nodes.

### 3. Replication

- Decide on the replication strategy (e.g., synchronous, asynchronous).
- Implement data replication to ensure data availability and fault tolerance.

### 4. Consistency

- Choose a consistency model (e.g., eventual consistency, strong consistency).
- Implement mechanisms to maintain the chosen consistency model (e.g., quorum reads/writes).

### 5. Coordination

- Implement coordination mechanisms for distributed transactions.
- Implement leader election and failure detection mechanisms.

### 6. Query Processing

- Implement query processing and optimization techniques.
- Ensure efficient data retrieval and manipulation.

### 7. Networking

- Implement networking protocols for communication between nodes.
- Ensure reliable and efficient data transfer.

### 8. Storage Engine

- Implement a storage engine to manage data on disk.
- Ensure efficient data storage and retrieval.

### 9. APIs

- Provide APIs for clients to interact with the database.
- Implement basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Define the Node Class

- Create a `Node` class to represent a node in the distributed database.
- Implement basic data storage and retrieval methods.

### Step 2: Define the Cluster Class

- Create a `Cluster` class to manage multiple nodes.
- Implement partitioning logic to distribute data across nodes.

### Step 3: Implement Replication

- Implement data replication across multiple nodes.
- Ensure data availability and fault tolerance.

### Step 4: Implement Consistency Mechanisms

- Implement consistency mechanisms (e.g., quorum reads/writes).
- Ensure data consistency across nodes.

### Step 5: Implement Coordination Mechanisms

- Implement leader election and failure detection mechanisms.
- Ensure reliable coordination between nodes.

### Step 6: Implement Query Processing

- Implement query processing and optimization techniques.
- Ensure efficient data retrieval and manipulation.

### Step 7: Implement Networking Protocols

- Implement networking protocols for communication between nodes.
- Ensure reliable and efficient data transfer.

### Step 8: Implement the Storage Engine

- Implement a storage engine to manage data on disk.
- Ensure efficient data storage and retrieval.

### Step 9: Provide APIs

- Provide APIs for clients to interact with the database.
- Implement basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

## Testing and Validation

- Test the distributed database for functionality, performance, and fault tolerance.
- Validate the implementation against the requirements.

## Documentation

- Document the architecture, design, and implementation details.
- Provide usage instructions and API documentation.

## Future Enhancements

- Explore advanced features such as distributed transactions, indexing, and query optimization.
- Improve performance, scalability, and fault tolerance.
